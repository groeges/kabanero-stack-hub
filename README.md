Stack hub for Kabanero

A stack hub is the central control point for application stacks that you want to use in your organization. These stacks might be clones of public stacks or they might be customized to meet local requirements. For example, you might want to include templates with unique starter applications, specify a different test framework, or ensure that your applications are developed on specific software levels.

Before building a stack hub you should identify the stacks that you want to use for developing your microservice applications. Clone the available stacks and make any modifications that are needed. How to customize, package, and publish stacks is covered in the [Customizing applications stacks](https://kabanero.io/guides/working-with-stacks/) guide.

The [Creating a stack hub](https://kabanero.io/guides/creating-a-stack-hub/) guide will cover how to build a stack hub that consolidates multiple application stacks for use in your organization, how to release your stack hub in GitHub, and how to use the assets in your deployment environment.
